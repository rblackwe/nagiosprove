0	 OK	 	 The plugin was able to check the service and it appeared to be functioning properly
1	 Warning	 The plugin was able to check the service, but it appeared to be above some "warning" threshold or did not appear to be working properly
2	 Critical	 The plugin detected that either the service was not running or it was above some "critical" threshold
3	 Unknown	 Invalid command line arguments were supplied to the plugin or low-level failures internal to the plugin (such as unable to fork, or open a tcp socket) that prevent it from performing the specified operation. Higher-level errors (such as name resolution errors, socket timeouts, etc) are outside of the control of plugins and should generally NOT be reported as UNKNOWN states.
